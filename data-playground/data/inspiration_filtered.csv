Ask your team what norms support inclusion and which hinder it. Ask them to share their thoughts about an inclusion ideal state.\n• Incorporate feedback mechanisms that allow for anonymous and/or confidential input (i.e. surveys, live polls). Remember that those who are feeling marginalized may have a difficult time speaking up in an open setting. \n• Revisit your inclusion goal(s). Are your goals aligned with the needs of your team? Is anything missing? Do you have actions in place to drive progress towards those goals? \n• Be vocal and transparent in driving progress in creating a more inclusive culture. Share the “why” to retain staff focus and buy-in.",Micro-mentoring to strengthen skills,"Once you have identified areas where you have an opportunity to improve your skills, reach out to people in your network who have strong skills in the areas you have gaps. Schedule an informal catch-up and ask them a few questions about their expertise. For example, if your knowledge of security is weak, spend one hour with the head of security to understand what threats are relevant for your team’s work. You'll be receiving micro-mentoring rather than needing to establish formal mentoring and you’ll gain relevant skills and pieces of knowledge in bite-size pieces as needed.",0.475327299491264,0.185667038779138,4,cust_ins,2018-05-28 18:59:13.988670,2018-05-28 19:03:31.397102,0.9417286840738864
