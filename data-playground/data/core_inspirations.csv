Challenge board,Document challenges and team up to find solutions,"Have a whiteboard where people can write up the challenges they are facing and work together to group the challenges into categories (for example: infrastructure, resources). Team members facing similar challenges can self-select and put their name against a challenge or category.

Shadow for a day,Get a deeper understanding of individual roles,"As a team leader or manager, shadow a team member for a few hours or a day, not to check up or manage but purely to learn what challenges they encounter. Often as people move into leadership roles they get further away from the day-to-day reality of our team members.

At one company, they also included what tools they use to complete their work and how people could track project progression. Additional topics that could be covered include: how to put in requests, or their most used resources.

Schedule an informal catch-up and ask them a few questions about their expertise. For example, if your knowledge of security is weak, spend one hour with the head of security to understand what threats are relevant for your team’s work.

What are the situations that I could have helped more but didn't?"" or ""What do you like about my management style and what could be improved?""

One-on-one meeting games,Add facilitated games to your one-on-ones,"Use facilitated games in your one-on-one meetings with a new direct report, to help them open up.

Ask them to outline what’s trying to be achieved and why, who it might impact, the possible solutions and impacts.

Check your assumptions,Revisiting problem solving to enable your team,"Before saying anything in response to your team asking you how to solve a problem, pause.

Pineapple pause,Create a code word to flag coaching opportunities,"Create an easy and fun way for team members to flag that you’ve jumped to a solution without asking questions using a code word. Agree on a code word (for example, ‘pineapple’) with your team and ask them to use it to flag when you when you offer a solution before asking questions.

Feedback moments,Encourage sharing of feedback by regularly asking for it,"Create a specific moment (for example ‘Feedback Friday’, or a stop, start, continue item on each 1:1 agenda) to make it easier for people to give feedback.

In a rapid feedback session each individual writes their name in the middle of an A4 piece of paper and tapes it to the wall. Then, all employees walk around with post-its writing down what they most admire and value about each person and stick it to each individual's paper. Employees feel appreciated and the feedback can give insight into what the employee should continue doing to best support their coworkers.

Skip level meetings,Implement skip level meetings around decision making,Foster open communication and alignment using skip-level meetings. Encourage people leaders who manage other people leaders to implement regular skip-level meetings. A skip level meeting occurs between a people leader and someone (or a group) two levels below them - without the people leader who those people report to attending - thereby skipping a layer of management. The people leader asks open questions to get an insight into how the people are going and can answer questions about the mission and objectives as well as how decisions are made. This fosters an open environment where employees feel included in important decisions. ,622179d7-b06b-4493-9b17-9f8d5ff5b7b0,2017-08-17T11:00:49.831106,2018-01-25T04:20:45.809673,My manager helps us set a clear strategy for achieving our goals,,MGRVIS.2

To support your team, why not write up a quick list with some common adjustments to make. Here are a few examples: As a general rule of thumb, it’s best to avoid words like normal and regular when describing people. No race, ability or gender is normal. When talking about someone else’s partner, using neutral terms like spouse, partner, or significant other (rather than girlfriend or husband, etc.) removes the assumption of sexuality and encourages respect for all orientations.

Growth-mindset Interventions,Reinforce the idea that anyone can become smarter,"Encourage people to have confidence that everyone can learn and improve by promoting a growth mindset. Messages that convey that human intelligence is fixed lead people to believe that intelligence is something that some people have and others do not.

Address Potential Stigmatizing Practices,Ensure diversity and inclusion initiatives are received well,"Address how diversity programs are designed to benefit the entire company and how they are not intended to decrease the competitiveness of any one group. Counterintuitively, some attempts to address diversity and inclusion can stigmatize the groups they are intended to benefit (Leslie, 2014). In some instances, it has been observed that recognition, training, and other programs that benefit women or underrepresented groups can cause majority groups to feel threatened. For example, white men may outright disagree with attempts to add diversity targets to the hiring funnel.

From the perspective of underrepresented groups, referral policies may suggest that organizations are uninterested in recruiting a diverse workforce and prefer to maintain the status quo. Employee referral policies can exacerbate gender and racial gaps in hiring by drawing from current employees' friendship and social networks.

After receiving survey feedback that employees didn't feel they could be open and honest, the executive team at one company instituted a practice called 'elephants, dead fish and vomit' at regular meetings. Elephants are the big things in the room nobody is talking about, dead fish are the things from the past people can't let go of and vomit is for those situations when someone just needs to be heard. Allocating time for this facilitates dialogue because time is set aside for people to share views that could align with the ideas of elephants, dead fish and/or vomit.",2c4f398f-161e-4f66-bb23-b5514355d477,2017-08-17T11:00:48.154054,2018-01-25T04:20:45.798787,There is open and honest two-way communication within our team,,TEA-COMM-3

Write it in the middle of the whiteboard then write down any thoughts that spring to mind (even if it isn’t an answer) around the question. Once you’ve got an initial set of thoughts, branch off more ideas from each thought. Then highlight the ones that resonate most, and take the ones that have promise and start planning.
